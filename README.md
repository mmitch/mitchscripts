# my personal script and configuration collection

This repository contains my personal configuration (`~/.bashrc`,
`~/.emacs` etc.) as well as various personal scripts that I like to
keep in sync on all my systems.

It also comes in handy if somebody asks *How did you make it do that?*
and the configuration can be readily browsed and shared via GitHub.
