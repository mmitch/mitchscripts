#
# fstrim.sh - trim filesystems
#
# Call with block devices, e.g. 'fstrim /dev/mapper/vg0-*'
#
# This script will check which of the given devices are currently
# mounted and will issue a TRIM command for every one that is.
# This script should be called daily or weekly from cron or anacron.
# Trimming via script has advantages over auto-trim via the 'discard'
# mount option, see http://blog.neutrino.es/2013/howto-properly-activate-trim-for-your-ssd-on-linux-fstrim-lvm-and-dmcrypt/
#
# BUGS: don't call on devices or mount paths containing shell metacharacters or the string " type "â€¦
